# Scraping Books API

This project is a tool for scraping books by ISBN from many sources.

It is represented in an API and you can test it by following these steps:

1. You need to download `ChromeDriver` [Download link](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/103.0.5060.53/chromedriver_win32.zip).
2. Extract it and add it to environment variables, You can simply run this command:
    `mv .\chromedriver.exe /usr/local/bin` in your terminal.
3. Open the project in your IDE and run it.
4. A Swagger API will be shown in your browser and you can use it to test the project.

If you find any bugs, please let me know. I will try to fix it as soon as possible.
